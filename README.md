## Implementations from the Scatch
This repo contains the implementations for following fundamental building blocks of modern vision related neural networks from the scratch (Just only using Python and Numpy),
 * Forward and backward passes of (in `cs231n/layers.py`), 
    1. Affine layer
    2. ReLU layer
    3. Batchnorm layer
    4. Layernorm layer
    5. Dropouts layer
    6. Spacial Batchnorm layer(for CNNs)
    7. Spacial Groupnorm layer(for CNNs)
    8. Maxpool layer(for CNNs)
    9. SVM Loss layer
    10. Softmax Loss layer
 * Implementation of CNN stack (in `cs231n/classifiers/cnn.py`)
 * Implementation of Fully connected stack (in `cs231n/classifiers/fc_net.py`)
 * Experimentation with Fully connected Nets (in `FullyConnectedNets.ipynb`)
 * Experimentation with Batchnorm (in `BatchNormalization.ipynb`)
 * Experimentation with Dropouts (in `Dropout.ipynb`)
 * Experimentation with CNN (in `ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb`)
 * Exploring Pytorch (in `PyTorch.ipynb`),
     1. Barebone API
     2. nn.Module API
     3. nn.Sequential API
 * Fooling CNNs by using input gradients (in `Network_Visualization.ipynb`)
 
 
 Note: All of above are developed for the assignments of cs231n, which is offered by Stanford. https://cs231n.github.io
